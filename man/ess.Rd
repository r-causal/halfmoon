\title{Calculate the Effective Sample Size (ESS)}
\usage{
ess(wts)
}
\arguments{
\item{wts}{A numeric vector of weights (e.g., from survey or
inverse-probability weighting).}
}
\value{
A single numeric value representing the effective sample size.
}
\description{
This function computes the effective sample size (ESS) given a vector of
weights, using the classical \eqn{(\sum w)^2 / \sum(w^2)} formula (sometimes
referred to as "Kish's effective sample size").
}
\details{
The effective sample size (ESS) reflects how many observations you
would have if all were equally weighted. If the weights vary substantially,
the ESS can be much smaller than the actual number of observations.
Formally:

\deqn{
  \mathrm{ESS} = \frac{\left(\sum_i w_i\right)^2}{\sum_i w_i^2}.
}

\strong{Diagnostic Value}:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Indicator of Weight Concentration}: A large discrepancy between ESS
and the actual sample size indicates that a few observations carry
disproportionately large weights, effectively reducing the usable
information in the dataset.
\item \strong{Variance Inflation}: A small ESS signals that weighted estimates are
more sensitive to a handful of observations, inflating the variance and
standard errors.
\item \strong{Practical Guidance}: If ESS is much lower than the total sample
size, it is advisable to investigate why some weights are extremely large
or small. Techniques like weight trimming or stabilized weights might be
employed to mitigate the issue

\examples{
# Suppose we have five observations with equal weights
wts1 <- rep(1.2, 5)
# returns 5, because all weights are equal
ess(wts1)

# If weights vary more, smaller than 5
wts2 <- c(0.5, 2, 2, 0.1, 0.8)
ess(wts2)
