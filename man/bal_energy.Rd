\usage{
bal_energy(
  .covariates,
  .exposure,
  .weights = NULL,
  estimand = NULL,
  .focal_level = NULL,
  use_improved = TRUE,
  standardized = TRUE,
  na.rm = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.covariates}{A data frame or matrix containing the .covariates to compare.}

\item{.exposure}{A vector (factor or numeric) indicating group membership. For
binary and multi-category treatments, must have 2+ unique levels. For
continuous treatments, should be numeric.}

\item{.weights}{An optional numeric vector of weights. If provided, must
have the same length as rows in \code{.covariates}. All weights must be non-negative.}

\item{estimand}{Character string specifying the estimand. Options are:
\itemize{
\item NULL (default): Pure between-group energy distance comparing distributions
\item "ATE": Energy distance weighted to reflect balance for estimating average
treatment effects across the entire population
\item "ATT": Energy distance weighted to reflect balance for the treated .exposure,
measuring how well controls match the treated distribution
\item "ATC": Energy distance weighted to reflect balance for the control .exposure,
measuring how well treated units match the control distribution
For continuous treatments, only NULL is supported.
}}

\item{.focal_level}{The treatment level for ATT/ATC. If \code{NULL} (default),
automatically determined based on estimand.}

\item{use_improved}{Logical. Use improved energy distance for ATE? Default is TRUE.
When TRUE, adds pairwise treatment comparisons for better group separation.}

\item{standardized}{Logical. For continuous treatments, return standardized
distance correlation? Default is TRUE.}

\item{na.rm}{A logical value indicating whether to remove missing values
before computation. If \code{FALSE} (default), missing values result in
an error (energy distance cannot be computed with missing data).}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the energy distance between groups. Lower
values indicate better balance, with 0 indicating perfect balance (identical
distributions). For continuous treatments, returns the distance correlation
coefficient (0 = independence, 1 = perfect dependence).
}
\description{
Computes the energy distance as a multivariate measure of covariate balance
between groups. Energy distance captures the similarity between distributions
across the entire joint distribution of .covariates, making it more comprehensive
than univariate balance measures.
}
\details{
Energy distance is based on the energy statistics framework (Székely & Rizzo, 2004)
and implemented following Huling & Mak (2024) and Huling et al. (2024).
The calculation uses a quadratic form: \eqn{w^T P w + q^T w + k},
where the components depend on the estimand.

For binary variables in the .covariates, variance is calculated as p(1-p)
rather than sample variance to prevent over-weighting.

For continuous treatments, the function uses distance correlation instead of
traditional energy distance, measuring independence between treatment and .covariates.
