\title{Calculate Effective Sample Size for Single Weight Vector}
\usage{
bal_ess(.weights, na.rm = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{.weights}{A numeric vector of weights or a single weight column from a data frame.}

\item{na.rm}{A logical value indicating whether to remove missing values
before computation. If \code{FALSE} (default), missing values in the input
will produce \code{NA} in the output.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value representing the effective sample size.
}
\description{
Computes the effective sample size (ESS) for a single weighting scheme.
This is a wrapper around \code{\link[=ess]{ess()}} that follows the bal_*() naming convention
for API consistency.
}
\details{
The effective sample size (ESS) is calculated using the classical formula:
\eqn{ESS = (\sum w)^2 / \sum(w^2)}.

ESS reflects how many observations you would have if all were equally weighted.
When weights vary substantially, the ESS can be much smaller than the actual
number of observations, indicating that a few observations carry
disproportionately large weights.

\strong{Diagnostic Value}:
\itemize{
\item A large discrepancy between ESS and the actual sample size indicates that
a few observations carry disproportionately large weights
\item A small ESS signals that weighted estimates are more sensitive to a handful
of observations, inflating the variance and standard errors
\item If ESS is much lower than the total sample size, consider investigating
why some weights are extremely large or small
}
}
\examples{
# ESS for ATE weights
bal_ess(nhefs_weights$w_ate)

# ESS for ATT weights
bal_ess(nhefs_weights$w_att)

# With missing values
weights_with_na <- nhefs_weights$w_ate
weights_with_na[1:5] <- NA
bal_ess(weights_with_na, na.rm = TRUE)
