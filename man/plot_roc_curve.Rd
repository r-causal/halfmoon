\description{
Creates a ggplot2 visualization of ROC curves for evaluating propensity score balance.
In causal inference, weighted curves near the diagonal (AUC around 0.5) indicate good balance.
}
\details{
ROC curves for balance assessment plot the true positive rate (sensitivity) against
the false positive rate (1 - specificity) when using propensity scores to classify
treatment assignment. When weights achieve perfect balance, the propensity score
distributions become identical between groups, yielding an ROC curve along the
diagonal (chance performance).

Curves that deviate substantially from the diagonal indicate that propensity
scores can still discriminate between treatment groups after weighting, suggesting
residual imbalance. The closer the curve is to the diagonal, the better the
balance achieved by the weighting scheme.
