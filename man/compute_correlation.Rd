\title{Compute Weighted or Unweighted Pearson Correlation}
\usage{
compute_correlation(x, y, weights = NULL, na_rm = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector containing the first variable.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector containing the second variable. Must have the same
length as \code{x}.}

\item{weights}{An optional numeric vector of case weights. If provided, must
have the same length as \code{x} and \code{y}. All weights must be non-negative.}

\item{na_rm}{A logical value indicating whether to remove missing values
before computation. If \code{FALSE} (default), missing values result in
\code{NA} output.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the correlation coefficient between -1 and 1.
Returns \code{NA} if either variable has zero variance.
}
\description{
Calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient between two numeric vectors,
with optional case weights. Uses the standard correlation formula for
unweighted data and weighted covariance for weighted data.
}
\examples{
# Basic usage
compute_correlation(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10))

# With weights
compute_correlation(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10),
                    weights = c(1, 1, 2, 2, 2))
