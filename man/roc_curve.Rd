\title{ROC Curve for Causal Inference}
\usage{
roc_curve(
  .data,
  .truth,
  .estimate,
  .wts = NULL,
  include_observed = TRUE,
  na.rm = TRUE,
  treatment_level = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A data frame containing the variables.}

\item{.truth}{The treatment/outcome variable (unquoted).}

\item{.estimate}{The propensity score or covariate (unquoted).}

\item{.wts}{Optional weighting variables (unquoted, can be multiple).}

\item{include_observed}{Include unweighted results? Default TRUE.}

\item{na.rm}{Remove missing values? Default TRUE.}

\item{treatment_level}{The level of \code{.truth} to consider as the treatment/event.
Default is NULL, which uses the second level.}
}
\value{
A tibble with ROC curve data.
}
\description{
Computes ROC curves (weighted or unweighted) for evaluating propensity score balance.
In causal inference, an ROC curve near the diagonal (AUC â‰ˆ 0.5)
indicates good balance between treatment groups.
