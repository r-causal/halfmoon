\usage{
plot_mirrored_distributions(
  .data,
  .var,
  .group,
  .wts = NULL,
  type = c("density", "histogram"),
  mirror_axis = "y",
  bins = NULL,
  binwidth = NULL,
  bw = "nrd0",
  adjust = 1,
  include_unweighted = TRUE,
  alpha = 0.6,
  na.rm = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A data frame containing the variables.}

\item{.var}{Variable to plot. Can be unquoted (e.g., \code{age}) or quoted (e.g., \code{"age"}).}

\item{.group}{Column name of treatment/group variable. Can be unquoted (e.g., \code{qsmk})
or quoted (e.g., \code{"qsmk"}). Must have exactly 2 levels.}

\item{.wts}{Optional weighting variable(s). Can be unquoted variable names,
a character vector, or NULL. Multiple weights can be provided to compare
different weighting schemes. Default is NULL (unweighted).}

\item{type}{Character; type of plot - "histogram" or "density". Default is "density".}

\item{mirror_axis}{Character; which axis to mirror - "y" (default) or "x".}

\item{bins}{Integer; number of bins for histogram. Only used when type = "histogram".}

\item{binwidth}{Numeric; width of bins for histogram. Only used when type = "histogram".
If both bins and binwidth are specified, binwidth takes precedence.}

\item{bw}{Bandwidth for density estimation. Only used when type = "density".
Can be numeric or character (e.g., "nrd0", "sj").}

\item{adjust}{Numeric; bandwidth adjustment factor for density. Only used when
type = "density". Default is 1.}

\item{include_unweighted}{Logical. If using \code{.wts}, also show unweighted
distribution? Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric; transparency level for fills. Default is 0.6.}

\item{na.rm}{Logical; if TRUE, drop NA values before plotting.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object.

\description{
Create mirrored distribution plots (histograms or density plots) to compare
the distribution of variables between treatment groups before and after
weighting. This function helps assess covariate balance by visualizing
the distributions side-by-side with one group mirrored below the axis.
}
\details{
Mirrored distribution plots display the distribution of one group above the
x-axis and the other group below (mirrored). This makes it easy to compare
distributions and assess balance. The function supports both histogram and
density plot types.

When using weights, the function can display both weighted and unweighted
distributions for comparison. Multiple weighting schemes can be compared
by providing multiple weight variables.

\examples{
library(ggplot2)

# Basic density plot (unweighted)
plot_mirrored_distributions(nhefs_weights, age, qsmk)

# Histogram instead of density
plot_mirrored_distributions(nhefs_weights, age, qsmk, type = "histogram", bins = 30)

# With weighting
plot_mirrored_distributions(nhefs_weights, age, qsmk, .wts = w_ate)

# Compare multiple weighting schemes
plot_mirrored_distributions(nhefs_weights, age, qsmk, .wts = c(w_ate, w_att))

# Customize appearance
plot_mirrored_distributions(
  nhefs_weights, age, qsmk,
  .wts = w_ate,
  type = "density",
  alpha = 0.7
)

# Without unweighted comparison
plot_mirrored_distributions(
  nhefs_weights, age, qsmk,
  .wts = w_ate,
  include_unweighted = FALSE
)
