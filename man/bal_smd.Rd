\title{Balance Standardized Mean Difference (SMD)}
\usage{
bal_smd(
  covariate,
  group,
  weights = NULL,
  reference_group = NULL,
  na.rm = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{covariate}{A numeric vector containing the covariate values to compare.}

\item{group}{A vector (factor or numeric) indicating group membership. Must
have exactly two unique levels.}

\item{weights}{An optional numeric vector of case weights. If provided, must
have the same length as \code{covariate}. All weights must be non-negative.}

\item{reference_group}{The reference group level to use as the comparison
baseline. Can be either a group level or index. If \code{NULL} (default), uses the first level.}

\item{na.rm}{A logical value indicating whether to remove missing values
before computation. If \code{FALSE} (default), missing values result in
\code{NA} output.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the standardized mean difference.
Positive values indicate the comparison group has a higher mean than
the reference group.
}
\description{
Calculates the standardized mean difference between two groups using the
smd package. This is a common measure of effect size for comparing group
differences while accounting for variability.
}
\examples{
bal_smd(nhefs_weights$age, nhefs_weights$qsmk)

# With weights
bal_smd(nhefs_weights$wt71, nhefs_weights$qsmk,
            weights = nhefs_weights$w_ate)

}
