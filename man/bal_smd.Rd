\title{Balance Standardized Mean Difference (SMD)}
\usage{
bal_smd(
  covariate,
  group,
  weights = NULL,
  reference_group = NULL,
  na.rm = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{covariate}{A numeric vector containing the covariate values to compare.}

\item{group}{A vector (factor or numeric) indicating group membership. Must
have exactly two unique levels.}

\item{weights}{An optional numeric vector of case weights. If provided, must
have the same length as other input vectors. All weights must be non-negative.}

\item{reference_group}{The reference group level for comparisons. Can be either
a group level value or a numeric index. If \code{NULL} (default), uses the first level.}

\item{na.rm}{A logical value indicating whether to remove missing values
before computation. If \code{FALSE} (default), missing values in the input
will produce \code{NA} in the output.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the standardized mean difference.
Positive values indicate the comparison group has a higher mean than
the reference group.
}
\description{
Calculates the standardized mean difference between two groups using the
smd package. This is a common measure of effect size for comparing group
differences while accounting for variability.
}
\details{
The standardized mean difference (SMD) is calculated as:
\deqn{SMD = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_0}{\sqrt{(s_1^2 + s_0^2)/2}}}
where \eqn{\bar{x}_1} and \eqn{\bar{x}_0} are the means of the treatment and control
groups, and \eqn{s_1^2} and \eqn{s_0^2} are their variances.

In causal inference, SMD values of 0.1 or smaller are often considered
indicative of good balance between treatment groups.
