\title{Create QQ plots for weighted and unweighted samples}
\usage{
plot_qq(
  .data,
  .var,
  .group,
  .wts = NULL,
  quantiles = seq(0.01, 0.99, 0.01),
  include_observed = TRUE,
  reference_group = 1L,
  na.rm = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A data frame containing the variables.}

\item{.var}{Variable to plot. Can be unquoted (e.g., \code{age}) or quoted (e.g., \code{"age"}).}

\item{.group}{Column name of treatment/group variable. Can be unquoted (e.g., \code{qsmk}) or quoted (e.g., \code{"qsmk"}).}

\item{.wts}{Optional weighting variable(s). Can be unquoted variable names,
a character vector, or NULL. Multiple weights can be provided to compare
different weighting schemes. Default is NULL (unweighted).}

\item{quantiles}{Numeric vector of quantiles to compute. Default is
\code{seq(0.01, 0.99, 0.01)} for 99 quantiles.}

\item{include_observed}{Logical. If using \code{.wts}, also show observed
(unweighted) QQ plot? Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{reference_group}{The reference group level to use for comparisons.
Defaults to 1 (first level).}

\item{na.rm}{Logical; if TRUE, drop NA values before computation.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object.
}
\description{
Create quantile-quantile (QQ) plots to compare the distribution of variables
between treatment groups before and after weighting. This function helps
assess covariate balance by visualizing how well the quantiles align between
groups.
}
\examples{
library(ggplot2)

# Basic QQ plot (observed)
plot_qq(nhefs_weights, age, qsmk)

# With weighting
plot_qq(nhefs_weights, age, qsmk, .wts = w_ate)

# Compare multiple weighting schemes
plot_qq(nhefs_weights, age, qsmk, .wts = c(w_ate, w_att))

# For propensity scores
plot_qq(nhefs_weights, .fitted, qsmk, .wts = w_ate)

# Without observed comparison
plot_qq(nhefs_weights, age, qsmk, .wts = w_ate, include_observed = FALSE)
